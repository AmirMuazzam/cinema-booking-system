# cinema-booking-system
This project is a cinema booking system developed as part of an assessment for a subject during my degree in Applied Mathematics. The goal of this system is to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to book movie tickets online and manage cinema showings efficiently.

The cinema booking system is implemented in C++ and consists of three main files: client.cpp, header.h, and implementation.cpp. The client.cpp file serves as the entry point for the program, while the header.h file contains the necessary function declarations and class definitions. The functionality and logic of the system are implemented in the implementation.cpp file.

The system allows customers to view available movies, select showtimes, choose seats, and make payments for their bookings. It also includes features such as seat availability updates, ticket price calculations, and reservation confirmations. The code utilizes object-oriented programming concepts and applies best practices for modularity and code organization.

This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a real-world application using C++ programming language. It showcases my skills in implementing user interfaces, managing data structures, and handling various functionalities required in a cinema booking system.

Please note that this project is developed solely for educational purposes as part of my degree assessment, and it may have limited functionalities and scope compared to a production-ready cinema booking system.

By sharing this project, I aim to showcase my programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and familiarity with software development practices. I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement and look forward to discussing this project further.
